# Game #1 - Poker

Provided:

* There are 52 cards in a deck and 2 players - Leon & Judy
* Each player will take a hand of 5 cards from the same deck
* A number is assigned for each rank (table 1)

| A | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | J | Q | K |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |

* The score of a hand is calculated with the steps below
    1. Identify 3 cards in 5 whose sum is divisible by 10
    2. If such 3-cards group can be identified, the score of 5-cards group is the sum of 2 rest cards if the sum is not greater than 10, or else it is the sum minus 10.
    3. If such 3-cards group can not be identified, the score is 0
    4. e.g score(J, Q, K, 5, 8) = 3, score(2, Q, K, 5, 3) = 10, score(A, 2, 3, 4, A) = 0, score(5, 6, 10, 9, 3) = 3
* If Leon's score is higher than Judy's then Leon beats Judy and vice visa
* If Leon's score equals Judy's then their highest rank will be compared in ascending order described in table 1 above. Therefore, hand (J, Q, K, 5, 8) beats (5, 6, 10, 9, 3)
* If the scores and the highest ranks of two hands both equal then the suits of cards with the highest rank will be compared in order spade(S) > heart(H) > club(C) > diamond(D). Therefore, "H9S7CAC2D7" (heart 9, spade 7, club A, club 2 and diamond 7) beats "D9D5C6S5DA".
* I made a record for every game they played that day in format ';' (e.g "H9S7CAC2D7;D9D5C6S5DA"). But they played so many times that I was totally lost. Could you please help me find out who won more?

Please write a program to generate two files - leon.txt for Leon's winning records and judy.txt for Judy's (the order of lines must be kept).

I tried my best to keep the correctness of my record but feel free to skip it if you find any game that doesn't make sense.

You may download my record atÂ [here](https://b1.rippletek.com/games/LJ-poker.txt).

For your quick verification, the first 3 lines of leon.txt should be:



```
C9D7D9S7D2;HAC5S8D8C10
DQSJD8C4DA;H3C9H7D6S2
S5HAHJS9DQ;D3S7C6D6S3
```



Thank you!
